    Jessica, I'm sad that you're leaving. You've been a great supervisor and 
    I appreciate all of the guidance and opportunities you've provided for me.
    It really won't be the same without you, but I wish you the best in your
    future endeavors. I hope we cross paths again someday. :-)

    Thank you so much for being a great supervisor
    and giving me my original opportunity as a contractor and the
    chance to prove myself as an FTE. It was good to work with you
    and learn so much from you. I wish you luck on all your future
    endeavors and am certain you'll do greate no matter where you end up.
    Take care.
